1. Define constants for input and output file names
2. Inside a try-catch block to handle IOException:
    a. Create a BufferedReader to read from the input file (inputFile).
    b. Create a BufferedWriter to write to the output file (outputFile).
    c. Read each line from the input file using the BufferedReader:
    i. If the line is not null, write the line to the output file followed by a newline character.
    d. Close the BufferedReader and BufferedWriter.
    e. Print a message indicating successful file content copying.
3. Catch any IOException that occurs during file read/write operations and print an error me

import java.io.*;

public class file{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        String inputFile = "input.txt";
        String outputFile = "output.txt";

        try{
            BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(inputFile));
            BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(outputFile));

            String line;
            while((line = reader.readLine()) != null){
                writer.write(line + "\n");
            }

            reader.close();
            writer.close();
            System.out.println("File contents copied successfully");

        } catch (IOException e){
            System.err.println("An error occurred during file read/write operation");
        }
    }
}
